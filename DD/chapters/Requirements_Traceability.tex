\section{Functional Requirements}
The design decisions illustrated in this document have been taken with the purpose to satisfy all the functional requirements listed in the RASD document. In this section, each requirement is mapped into the corresponding design components.
The mapping can be better understood by observing the \hyperlink{RV}{\underline{Runtime view, section 2.5}}, in which is illustrated the sequential order of the interaction between each design component, in order to accomplish the functional requirements.\\
Other important diagrams that integrate the following mapping, are in the\\ \hyperlink{CV}{\underline{Component view, section 2.3}}.
