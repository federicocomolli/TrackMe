\section{Functional Requirements}
Data4Help:  
\begin{enumerate} [label={[G\arabic*]}]
    \item Allow a visitor to become registered user after providing credentials.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D1]}] Users insert credentials that correspond to their identity.
            \item [{[D2]}] When a new registered user sends his/her credentials to the system, the message will be surely received.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Monitor the location of users through electronic devices.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D3]}] The communication channel doesn't corrupt the data sent by the user's device to the system and vice versa.
            \item [{[D4]}] Users locations are retrieved by GPS.
            \item [{[D7]}] Position information provided by GPS is sufficiently accurate.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Monitor the health status of users through electronic devices.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D3]}] The communication channel doesn't corrupt the data sent by the user's device to the system and vice versa.
            \item [{[D5]}] The electronic device on which the system is installed is equipped with the sensors related to the parameters tracked by Data4Help.
            \item [{[D6]}] The  system  retrieves  the  data  from  the  sensors  through  the  interfaces available on the electronic device.
            \item [{[D8]}] The sensors related to the health status collect the data with a reasonable precision.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Allow a user to accept or refuse a request to access to personal data.
    
    \item Allow third parties to register to the system.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D1]}] Users insert credentials that correspond to their identity.
            \item [{[D1]}] When a new registered user sends his/her credentials to the system, the message will be surely received.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Allow third parties to request an access to users' data.
    \begin{enumerate} [label*={.\arabic*}]
        \item [{[G6.1]}] Allow third parties to request access to data of some specific individuals by providing SSN or Fiscal Code.
        \item [{[G6.2]}] Allow third parties to request access to anonymized data of group of people.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Accept request for data of group of people only if the system can guarantee the anonymity of the people.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D9]}] It’s sufficient that the number of people involved in a group query is greater than 1000 people to ensure the users’ privacy.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Allow third parties to subscribe to new data and to receive them as soon as they are produced.
\end{enumerate}

AutomatedSOS:
\begin{enumerate} [resume, label={[G\arabic*]}]
    \item Allow a visitor to become registered user after providing credentials.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D1]}] Users insert credentials that correspond to their identity.
            \item [{[D2]}] When a new registered user sends his/her credentials to the system, the message will be surely received.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Monitor the location of users through electronic devices.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D3]}] The communication channel doesn't corrupt the data sent by the user's device to the system and vice versa.
            \item [{[D4]}] Users locations are retrieved by GPS.
            \item [{[D7]}] Position information provided by GPS is sufficiently accurate.
            \item [{[D11]}] Data  provided  by  Data4Help  API  are  surely  received  and  they  are  not corrupted.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Monitor the health status of users through electronic devices.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [{[D3]}] The communication channel doesn't corrupt the data sent by the user's device to the system and vice versa.
            \item [{[D5]}] The electronic device on which the system is installed is equipped with the sensors related to the parameters tracked by Data4Help.
            \item [{[D6]}] The  system  retrieves  the  data  from  the  sensors  through  the  interfaces available on the electronic device.
